Projects:

### Cubes are acute
An rts developed in 2011 in 3D where you can build & control units to fight.
There is an AI that can play versus each others or versus the player.

Me, Martin and Jonathan worked on this project together.

### Pathfinding
A* pathfinding implementation in 2011. There are 2 maps in the project to test against.  

This is also a breath & depth first implementation.
The A* Pathfinding is originally written by Martin for Cubes are acube project that I modified this pathfinding project.

### BoardGame
A turn based strategy game board game we made in a 5man project in early 2012. 
Me & Martin did database, game design and game logic in PHP and javascript.

The database stored all a players move + the random seed making the game completly deterministic.
The file `BoardGame/spelplan/testingGame.html` bypasses the server and is playable.
