Major bugs:

- When animation goes from frame end -> 0 (start) it sucks.

- Some bug that causes the first animation sequence to not work properly.

- Lights are totally not working as intended, probably a normal issue

- The "auto position" function does not work with bone modifiers, so it should take those in account when calculating the auto position.

Minor bugs:

- If ModelListSliderView.m_currentSliderIndex is greater than ModelListView.m_items.length
LoadingGIF is visible and stays visible until you select a model. Could confuse a user!

- If user clicks on a model and it doesn't load and then goes back to a loaded model the loading GIF is still visible.
